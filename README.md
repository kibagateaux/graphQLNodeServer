#GraphQL / Node Template 

#Initialization
Clone this repo, run `yarn install`, and then `node .` to start the server.

#What's in the template?
An [`express-graphql`](https://github.com/graphql/express-graphql) server with PSQL database and [`sequlize`](http://docs.sequelizejs.com/) ORM.

Basic GraphQl user type and query as a reference for development. 

Haven't gotten around to making Mutations work.
